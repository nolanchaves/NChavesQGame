Q-Puzzle game is a puzzle game consisting of several colored doors and boxes.
   
The number of doors and boxes may vary, however, for the same-colored boxes there must be at least one matching colored door.

The control pad will contain four directional buttons: Up, Down, Left and Right.
   
The player will select a box by clicking and use the control pad to move the box.

The box will continue to move until it hits a wall or another box. 

If there is a door with the same color of the box in the direction of its movement, the box will be removed.

Your objective will be to remove all the boxes through their corresponding colored doors and the game ends.
